# World_Weather_Analysis

## Challenge
Build Python programming skills using try-except blocks, input statements and nested decision statements, logical expressions, and Pandas methods and attributes to make an API request and build a new DataFrame. Filtered the DataFrame to create a marker layer map, and a directions layer Google map that shows directions to travel between multiple cities.

## Background
Created new modifications to the PlanMyTrip app by adding more data to the database, or cities DataFrame, so that customers know the weather in the cities when they click on a pop-up marker. Added the amount of rainfall or snowfall within the last three hours so that customers can filter the DataFrame using input statements based on the temperature range and whether or not it is raining or snowing. Finally, customers are able to find directions between multiple cities for travel.
